Well-known Conway's Game of Life is usually played on the infinite plane board. But one can also consider it on finite surfaces without boundaries: the torus, the Klein bottle and the projective plane.

The aim of this repository is to search for stable and repeating patterns on such boards exhaustively and effectively.

Source code can be found in src/. Just run

make clean
# Produce code for given board's size and topology
make all N=[1..8] TOPOLOGY=[torus|klein|projective]
# Compute list of periodical patterns and save it to life.dump
./life life.dump
# Calculate periods
cat life.dump | ./undump > life.undump
# Overview found periods
./stat.awk life.undump | sort -n

Detailed description of the algorithm will be available soon.

In undump/ one can find the lists of found patterns for N=2..6 and all three topologies. Each line of the list contains a pattern (encoded as binary sequence) and its period.
